# Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Projects

Welcome to the Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Projects folder! This repository contains a collection of projects developed using OOP principles and techniques in C++. Each project demonstrates various aspects of OOP, including class design, inheritance, encapsulation, polymorphism, and more. These projects were completed as part of my coursework in the OOP course at the University of Lodz.

## Key Concepts and Techniques

- **Class Design:** Each project involves designing and implementing classes to model real-world entities and their interactions.
- **Encapsulation:** Classes encapsulate data and behavior, hiding internal implementation details and providing a clean interface for interacting with objects.
- **Inheritance:** Inheritance is used to create a hierarchy of classes, allowing for code reuse and specialization.
- **Polymorphism:** Polymorphism allows objects of different classes to be treated interchangeably, enabling dynamic behavior and flexibility in program design.
- **Operator Overloading:** Overloaded operators are used to provide intuitive syntax for performing operations on objects.
- **Exception Handling:** Exception handling is used to handle error conditions and ensure program robustness.
- **Dynamic Memory Management:** Dynamic memory allocation is used to manage resources dynamically, such as allocating memory for arrays of variable size.
